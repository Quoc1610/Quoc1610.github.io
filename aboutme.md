Hi, I'm Nguyen Tran Quoc, a passionate Unity Developer. Here's a quick snapshot of who I am:

Skilled in Unity – I create immersive games and interactive experiences with Unity.
Problem Solver – I love taking on challenges and finding creative solutions in game development.
Team Player – I believe that great things happen when teams work together toward a shared goal.
Detail-Oriented – From coding to design, I ensure every element is finely tuned.
What else? Well, let's just say I'm always looking to improve my skills and push the boundaries of what's possible in Unity.

While I can write you a whole chapter about my journey, why don't you take a look at some of the games and projects I've worked on?
